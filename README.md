# gcode_replacer
Takes specific GCODE lines and replaces them with the GCODE you want instead


I use this programm to generate gcode for my cnc plotter. I use the laser plugin for "Inkscape" and generate gcode.
In this file I then replace the m5 and m3 with the gcode I need to move the pen up and down.

I also skip/delete the "G4 P0" command generated by inkscape.

You can choose which gcode you want to have replaced as well as what you want to replace it with.

The file gets saved in the same directory with a "-TRANSFORMED" attached to the file name.
